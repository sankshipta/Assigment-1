                In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. 
                In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. 
                That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. 
                In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.

                <b> HTML 2</b><br>
                November 24, 1995
                HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
                November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
                May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)
                August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)
                January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization) <br> <br>
                <b> HTML 3 </b><br>
                January 14, 1997
                HTML 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.
                Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
                A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.<br> <br>
                <b> HTML 4</b><br>
                December 18, 1997
                HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
                Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden
                Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed
                Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.
                Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<br><br>
                April 24, 1998
                HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
                December 24, 1999
                HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata were published on May 12, 2001.
                May 2000
                ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing languages).
                After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.<br><br>
               <b>HTML 5  </b> <br>
                Main article: HTML5
                October 28, 2014
                HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
                November 1, 2016
                HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
                December 14, 2017
                HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.<br><br>

            <p> <i>HTML</i> elements are the building blocks of <i> HTML</i> pages. With <I>HTML</I> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
             <i>HTML</i> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. 
             <i> HTML </i> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <-image> and <-input> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <-p> and <-/p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. 
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
